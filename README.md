# Striver-SDE-Sheet-Solutions
Hello, all.! This repo gives you the solutions for coding questions that are listed on Striver's SDE sheet where a collection of around 180 questions are deployed.
I will be uploading all the solutions in python language as I code using python. 
SDE Sheet contains very handily crafted and picked top coding interview questions from different topics of Data Structures & Algorithms. These questions are one of the most asked coding interview questions in coding interviews of companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Media.net, Flipkart, etc, and cover almost all of the concepts related to Data Structure & Algorithms.
